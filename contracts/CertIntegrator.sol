/**
 *  @notice The Cert integrator contract
 *
 *  1. While the FeedbackRegistry contracts will be deployed on multiple chains, another contracts
 *  will only be present on its main chain. This contract is a Solidity contract that solves
 *  the previous problem.
 *
 *  2. This contract will be deployed on the supported chains, and its purpose is to store and
 *  provide the ability to update data about courses and their participants from the chains.
 *
 *  3.This data is the root of the Sparse Merkle tree that contains course participants. Whenever
 *  a certificate is issued or a new course is created, the CertIntegration service will
 *  update the data. This way, every instance of FeedbackRegistry on different chains will have
 *  the latest and most up-to-date data available.
 *
 *  4. The course identifier - is its adddress as every course is represented by NFT contract.
 *
 *  5. Requirements:
 *
 *      - The ability to update the state for a specific course. It is only for a contract owner.
 *
 *      - The contract must store all roots, to avoid collision when the user generates a ZKP for
 *        a specific merkle root, but after several seconds this root is replaced by the CertIntegrator
 *        service. Also, the contract should bind up every state to the block number. It will provide
 *        an ability for external services to set some interval of blocks in which they will consider
 *        this state valid.
